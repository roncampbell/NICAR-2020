# NICAR-2020

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> 
in New Orleans on March 7, 2020. A tip sheet and data are included. 

To get the data and maps, click on the "Branch: master" box next to the "New pull request" box and click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see the CSV files and five files named LA_parishes with the suffixes .shp, .dbf, .prj, .qpj and .shx; these five files together comprise a shapefile for mapping Louisiana parishes. People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, sf, viridis, plotly and htmlwidgets packages.
